This script is a first boot script that sets separate power management settings for desktops and laptops.

If it's a laptop, the power management settings for "Battery" are set to have the computer sleep in 15 minutes, disk will spin down 
in 10 minutes, the display will sleep in 5 minutes and the display itself will dim to half-brightness before sleeping. While plugged 
into the AC adapter, the power management settings for "Charger" are set to have the computer never sleep, the disk doesn't spin down, 
the display sleeps after 30 minutes and the display dims before sleeping.

If it's not a laptop (i.e. a desktop), the power management settings are set to have the computer never sleep, the disk doesn't spin down, 
the display sleeps after 30 minutes and the display dims before sleeping.
