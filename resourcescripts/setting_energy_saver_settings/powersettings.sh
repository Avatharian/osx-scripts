# Set separate power management settings for desktops and laptops
# If it's a laptop, the power management settings for "Battery" are set to have the computer sleep in 15 minutes, disk will spin down 
# in 10 minutes, the display will sleep in 5 minutes and the display itself will dim to half-brightness before sleeping. While plugged 
# into the AC adapter, the power management settings for "Charger" are set to have the computer never sleep, the disk doesn't spin down, 
# the display sleeps after 30 minutes and the display dims before sleeping.
# 
# If it's not a laptop (i.e. a desktop), the power management settings are set to have the computer never sleep, the disk doesn't spin down, 
# the display sleeps after 30 minutes and the display dims before sleeping.

# Detects if this Mac is a laptop or not by checking the model ID for the word "Book" in the name.
