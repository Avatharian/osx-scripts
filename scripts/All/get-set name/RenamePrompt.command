#This script is the second version of the Apply Name script. 
#It first checked for the existence of a name file from the previous scripts.
#If it finds one, it prompts the user with the found name.
#It then asks the user if they want to change the name.
#If it does not find a file, or the user selects Y, it asks the user for a new name
#then names the computer with that.
#If the user selects N (or any answer that is not Y, need to fix that), it exits.

#Special Note: When running from the K2000, in order to get a visible terminal
#window, this script must be saved as a .command file, and run from the K2000 with the command
#"open -W <script>.command"
