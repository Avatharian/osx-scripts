README

This set of scripts is meant to be used to keep computer names consistent across
re-imaging of Macintosh computers. They are meant to be run in the following order:

1. getname.sh
2. copyname.sh
3a. applynamenoprompt.sh
3b. RenamePrompt.sh

Q. mac_rename.sh

That last one is independent of the others, and should be run alone if used. It forgoes copying
the previous name and instead uses a .txt database of name in a format explained in the script.
I'll probably just move it into it's own directory since it doesn't belong with the others.
